# Senior Project: Sam Kamenetz 2016
Code, paper, and presentation of my senior project.


Applied document classification models towards predicting the genre tags of fan-fiction stories, and evaluate the effectiveness of such a system. I used a Linear SVC multi-label classification system, using the Bag of Words model for each document. Refer to slideshow in project for overview, and the paper for details.
