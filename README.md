Iâ€™m getting decent results, just by eyeballing the data. Those that are misstagged are suspect in their actual tags.
I currently need to adjust the pulling function so that it does not grab duplicates (it just throws out duplicates currently)
I want to have a function that grabs stories by comments, likes, dislikes, favorites, and see which yields the most accurate results. Have to see with what confidence we can retag poorly rated stories.
